Dojo Unit v. 0.2
by Hugo Corbucci & Dojo participant's contributions

Description
-----------
The Dojo Unit is a small C Unit tests library with some utilities scripts.
The 'src' folder contains the code file (dojo_unit.c) and header file (dojo_unit.h) that form the library.
The 'tests' folder contains tests for the dojo library.
The 'scripts' folder contains various scripts to generate files required to run the tests or create projects.

Known Issues
------------
So far, the library works only under Mac OS X and Linux (problems with LD_LIBRARY_PATH still to be solved under Linux).
Once make install is ready, this should be solved.


How to run
-----------
'make' to compile the library and run the tests printing a default summary. If successful, the generated library is copied to the
template project and it can be used to create new projects.
'make zip' or 'make tar' or 'make targz' create a compressed version of the code.
To create your own projects, enter the script folder and run ./create_project NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT. This will create a folder 
with the name of your project on the dojo unit home with all replaced. Then just alter the files on the 'src' and 'tests' folder
of your project.
